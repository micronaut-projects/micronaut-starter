The subproject `starter-cli` provides an implementation that can be run as a Command Line Application (CLI).

=== Building Locally

From the project root:

[source,cmd]
----
./gradlew clean micronaut-cli:assemble
----

Now you can run the following the start the CLI in interactive mode:

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
java -jar starter-cli/build/libs/micronaut-cli-{version}-all.jar
----

=== Building a Native Image

Install GraalVM and Native Image.
Follow the steps in the previous section to build the CLI and then run:

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
native-image --no-fallback -cp starter-cli/build/libs/micronaut-cli-{version}-all.jar
----

This will produce the `mn` executable which you can start with:

[source,cmd]
----
./mn
----
