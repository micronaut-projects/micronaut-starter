The subproject `starter-aws-lambda` provides a function that can be deployed to AWS Lambda as a GraalVM native image.

=== Running the Lambda Locally

From the root of the project run:

[source,cmd]
----
$ docker build . -f DockerfileLambda -t micronaut-starter
$ mkdir -p build
$ docker run --rm --entrypoint cat micronaut-starter  /home/application/function.zip > build/function.zip
----

Then start the function with SAM (https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-cli).

[source,cmd]
----
$ sam local start-api --template sam-local.yml
----

And visit http://localhost:3000/

=== Continuous Deployment

The Micronaut Starter API is continuously deployed by GitHub Actions to https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/[AWS Lambda] as a Serverless GraalVM native application using a custom AWS Lambda Runtime .

The https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-starter/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Snapshot+to+AWS+Lambda%22[Snapshot to AWS Lambda Workflow] (defined by `.github/workflows/gcf-snapshot.yml`) deploys the application on each commit and the API can be accessed at the following URL:
