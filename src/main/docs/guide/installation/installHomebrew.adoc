In order to install Micronaut, run following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ brew install --cask micronaut-projects/tap/micronaut
----

You can find more information about Homebrew usage on their https://brew.sh/[homepage].

You should now be able to run the Micronaut CLI.

TIP: On macOS, you may get a warning message saying that `“mn” cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.`.
To resolve it, click the Apple menu, and select *System Settings*.
Then browse to *Privacy & Security*, and scroll down to the *Security* section.
There should be a warning that `"mn" was blocked`, with an *Allow Anyway* button.
Clicking this button will fix the issue.

See the https://docs.brew.sh/FAQ#why-cant-i-open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer[Homebrew documentation] for more details about this.
