# Telegram ChatBot

Follow the instructions in the [Micronaut ChatBot Documentation](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-chatbots/latest/guide/) to create a Telegram ChatBot.

Once you have a username and HTTP auth key for your new bot, edit the application config in this project to set the bot username and make up a WEBHOOK_TOKEN so you can ensure it's Telegram that's calling your bot.

@Rocker.template(platformTemplate, project, features, buildCommand)

You can then set up the Telegram webhook by running the following command:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.telegram.org/bot${HTTP_AUTH_KEY}/setWebhook?url=${YOUR_HTTP_TRIGGER_URL}&secret_token=${YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN}'
```

Where HTTP_AUTH_KEY is the key given to you by the BotFather, YOUR_HTTP_TRIGGER_URL is the URL of your HTTP function and YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN is the value you chose for the WEBHOOK_TOKEN in the configuration.
