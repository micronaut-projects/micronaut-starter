This project has a dependency on `micronaut-chatbots-telegram-http` which has added a controller to your application with the path `/telegram`.

When registering your bot with Telegram, you will need to provide the HTTPS URL of your application including this path.
If you are running your application locally, you can use a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your application to the internet.
