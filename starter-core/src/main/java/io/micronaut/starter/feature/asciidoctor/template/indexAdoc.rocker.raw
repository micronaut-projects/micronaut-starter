Write a short introduction about your project

Explain what it requires and how to build the project. For example:

This project requires Java 8 (min) and you can build it executing the following command:

[source,console]
----
./gradlew build
----

== Architecture

When you document your architecture you can use different `diagrams` blocks as
for example `plantuml`

[plantuml]
----
Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request
Bob --> Alice: Authentication Response

Alice -> Bob: Another authentication Request
Alice <-- Bob: another authentication Response
----

== Implementation

Remember you can include piece of code extracted from your project using the `include` directive

    include::{sourcedir}/com/mycompany/service/MyService.java[tags=init]
